### 🖼 Description

**Modern-Office-Day-Icons** is a modern, unified icon set designed to complement the [Modern-Office-Day GTK theme](https://www.pling.com/p/2302153/).
It aims to deliver a clean and visually consistent desktop experience for Linux Mint Cinnamon users — but it works well with other GTK-based desktops too. The design draws inspiration from modern commercial operating systems — without using any commercial assets — resulting in a clean, neutral, and professional aesthetic that matches the GTK theme.

The set includes redesigned system icons, updated application icons, and custom folder styles to enhance clarity and harmony across the system.

It is partially based on open source icon themes licensed under the GPL, such as:

* **Breeze** – many icons were used as-is or modified
* **Numix-Circle** – used occasionally for some application icons
* **Papirus** – used in very small parts (e.g., one or two icons)
* **Hicolor** – one or two icons included from this fallback theme

**Modern-Office-Day** is a derivative of the **[Mint Breeze Light](https://www.pling.com/p/2326676/)** theme, which itself is based on Breeze.

This project is more than just a mix of existing icon sets. I have also:

* Redesigned many outdated icons to match a modern aesthetic
* Created numerous icons from scratch
* Carefully curated and unified the overall look to better fit the Cinnamon environment
